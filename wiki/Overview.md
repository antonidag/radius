## 1. Overview

This document defines the **Way of Working** for development teams using **GitHub**.
* **Branching strategy** and rules
* **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipelines
* **GitHub Packages** for artifact publishing
* **GitHub Releases** for versioning and deployment tagging

The goal is to ensure a consistent, secure, and traceable development and deployment process.

## 2. Branching Strategy

### Key Branches

| Branch         | Purpose                 | Naming Convention  |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| `main`         | Production-ready code   | Protected          |
| `feature/int*` | New feature development | `feature/int123-*` |
| `hotfix/int*`  | Critical fixes to main  | `hotfix/int123-*`  |

### Protections

**`main` branch rules:**

* Require pull requests
* Require at least 1 code review
* Disallow self-review (Optional)
* Disallow direct and force pushes

**`feature/*` and `hotfix/*` rules:**

* Enforce naming conventions (`feature/int{number}-*`, `hotfix/int{number}-*`)
* Disallow force pushes

### Merging Guidelines

* All merges into `main` must occur via pull requests.
* Reviews are mandatory before merge.
* CI checks must pass before a merge is allowed.

## 3. GitHub Actions

### Overview

GitHub Actions are used to automate build, package, promote, deploy, and rollback workflows.

### Key Workflows

| Workflow File          | Trigger                          | Purpose                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `build.yml`            | Manual on `feature/int*` and `hotfix/int*`         | Package & push to GHCR           |
| `promote.yml`          | Label-based or merge to `main`   | Tag image and prepare for deploy |
| `deploy.yml`           | Called by `promote.yml`/rollback | Pull, extract & deploy package   |
| `rollback.yml`         | Manual trigger                   | Rollback deployment              |
| `promote-by-label.yml` | Label added to PR                | Trigger promote + deploy         |
| `deploy-on-merge.yml`  | PR merged to `main`              | Promote & deploy to production   |

### Modular Patterns

* Workflows are broken down into discrete responsibilities (build, promote, deploy).
* Triggers use a combination of manual triggers, labels, and events.

## 4. GitHub Packages

### Artifact Strategy

Artifacts are built as part of the `build.yml` workflow:

* Code is zipped as `/artifact/integration.zip`
* Docker image is built with the zip file embedded
* Images are tagged as `latest`, then re-tagged as `:dev`, `:test`, `:prod` during promotion

### Publishing

* Artifacts are pushed to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**
* Naming convention: `int*` per integration

### üóÉÔ∏è Retention

TBD


## 5. GitHub Releases

### üìå Versioning

* Follows: `Integration Application: {integration name} {curernt date}`
* Tied to deployments for production made via `deploy.yml`

### Creating Releases

* Releases are generated automatically for production
* Release notes include:

  * Integration version
  * Git SHA or tag
  * Link to package
  * Developer


## 6. Recommended Workflow

### Developer

1. Create a new branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/int123-add-logging
   ```
2. Push changes and optionally trigger manual `build.yml`.

### Pull Request

3. Open a pull request to `main`.
4. Add a label if deploying to `dev`/`test` (`deploy-dev`, `deploy-test`).

### Code Review & Checks

5. Ensure code review is done and CI checks pass.
6. Reviewer removes any deployment label to avoid retriggering.

### Merge

7. Merge the pull request into `main`.
8. This triggers:

   * `promote.yml` (for `:prod`)
   * `deploy.yml` (to deploy to production)

### Deployment

9. GitHub Actions will:

   * Pull Docker image
   * Extract integration zip
   * Deploy infrastructure/code
   * Generate release notes

### Rollback (If Needed)

10. Manually trigger `rollback.yml` with integration ID and version tag.

## Folder Structure and Deployment Process

The organization of the integration folders directly determines what gets deployed and how, as described below:

- **iac/**: If present, triggers infrastructure-as-code deployment (e.g., Terraform). If `main.tf` exists, it is used for the main deployment. If `post.tf` exists, post-deployment steps are executed.
- **logicapp/**: If present, Logic App code is deployed.
- **funcapp/**: If present, Function App code is deployed.

During deployment, the workflow inspects each integration's folder for these subfolders. Only the components found are deployed, making the process flexible and modular. This means you can include only the folders relevant to your integration, and the deployment pipeline will automatically handle them accordingly.

**Example:**

```
int2001/
  iac/
    main.tf
    post.tf
  logicapp/
    ...
  funcapp/
    ...
```

In this example, all three components (IaC, Logic App, and Function App) will be deployed, including post-deployment steps.
